## Contract Architecture

The architecture   of the   contracts is based on [EIP-2535 Diamond MultiFacet Proxy](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) with some changes mainly to be compatible with regular block explorers like Etherscan. Main goals:

- **Modularity** - As the system evolves, we need to be able to move fast incorporating or changing functionalities without facing limitations like the contract size or disturbing existing architecture.
- **Upgradeability** - Allowing the DAO to evolve the system or solve issues. The process can be deactivated if such a decision is made.
- **Resilient innovation** - To encourage developer adoption, we designed a system easy to integrate and use.

### Main components

#### SSVNetwork

It's the main entry point for users, used for operations and management. It acts as a proxy for the _module_ contracts, where all functions that contain logic reside. All events are fired from the SSVNetwork contract.

It's an [UUPS](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1822) upgradeable contract. Apart from the state variables inherited by the UUPS Openzeppelin implementation, the contract storage is managed by the [Diamond storage pattern](https://eip2535diamonds.substack.com/i/65777640/diamond-storage) using a specific library.

The fallback function is implemented to delegate all calls to the SSVViews module.
Any module interface can be used with this contract, so then you can access only the functions and events related to the specific interface of the module. This is helpful when you want access to a restricted set of functionalities belonging to Operators, Clusters, etc.

#### SSVNetworkViews

It's the main contract for reading information about the network and its participants.

#### Modules

Non-upgradeable, stateless contracts that contain the logic to support Clusters, Operators, and Protocol (DAO / Network) functionalities.

**Important**: Interacting directly with module contracts is not effective as you are not interacting with the correct state maintained by the main contract `SSVNetwork`. All interactions should be done via main contracts: `SSVNetwork` or `SSVNetworkViews`.

#### Libraries

Libraries are a fundamental part of the architecture to support reusable pieces efficiently. Also, `SSVStorage` and `SSVStorageProtocol` implement the Diamond storage pattern.

#### SSV Token

The native SSV token is used to facilitate payments between stakers and SSV node operators to maintain their validators.
